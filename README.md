In October 2023, our group attended the TMMC Innovation Software Challenge held in the Ideas Clinic at the University of Waterloo. We were tasked with the challenge of using CV to identify holes and stickers placed on an engine bay, in an effort to develop an automatic inspection of an automonous sitcker application developed by TMMC.
